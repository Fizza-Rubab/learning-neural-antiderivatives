# Training and Evaluation of Derivative of Gaussians (DoG)

This directory contains scripts to **train and evaluate neural antiderivatives using smooth estimators**.  
Experiments can be run across different dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D), signal types (analytic vs. real data), and integration orders.

---

The training files in the experiments folder can be used to train any of the models.
Evaluation files will be made ready soon to work with the provided trained models and data format.
